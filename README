This project contains the source code and test fixtures for a basic Discrete
Event Simulation framework.  This framework could provide the basis for an
arbitrarily complex simullation environment.  I expect that others will derive
from the base classes provided here to create more "interesting" simulation
tools.

The basic framework is a provided as a set of classes in the "desim/" and
"util/" directories.  As you might expect "desim/" contains the Discrete Event
Simulation executive, as well as the base simulation event type.

"examples/text_event/" contains an example program that uses these classes to
build about the most basic simulator that I could imagine.

"tests/" contains several unit tests for the simulation environment.  Each of
these test directories contains a "makefile" and a "run_test.bsh" script to
actually execute the test and report the results.

"scripts/" contains a number of useful utility scripts, many are used by the
tests.

"scripts/run_all_test.bsh" will sequentially make and run all of the
tests.

"scripts/update_version.bsh" is the recommended way to roll the simulator's
version number and revision date information.  This script properly updates
the information in both the source code and the test directories.

Future Work:
  - Expand the test coverage to provide more complete evaluations of the
    functionality
  - Add a Continuous Simulation engine to complement the existing DES engine
  - Clean up the comments and documentation.
