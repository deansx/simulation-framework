#   DESCRIPTION:
#     Script to run the regression test for the argument parser.
#     
#     The argument parser is tested by invoking the test program with
#     various argument combinations, while directing std out / err out
#     to a file, which can be compared to a reference file to verify
#     that the argument parser worked as expected.
#     
#     Pass/fail counts are maintained and reported at the end of the
#     script
#   
#     The failure count is returned by this script.
#
