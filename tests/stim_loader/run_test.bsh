#   DESCRIPTION:
#     Script to run the regression test for the StimLoader and
#     StimTextEventLoader classes.
#     
#     The StimTextEventLoader class functionality is tested by loading a known
#     stimulus file, running a simulation, and then verifying that both the
#     resulting logfile, and the transcript of the session match corresponding
#     reference files.
#     
#     Pass/fail counts are maintained and reported at the end of the
#     script.
#
#     The script returns the total failure count.
#
