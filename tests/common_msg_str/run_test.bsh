#   DESCRIPTION:
#     Script to run the regression test for the common_ messages & strings
#     modules.
#     
#     The common_messages and common_strings modules are tested by invoking
#     the test executable with various arguments, while directing stdout and
#     errout to files, which can be compared to corresponding reference
#     files to verify that the module test executable worked as expected.
#     
#     Pass/fail counts are maintained and reported at the end of the
#     script
#
#     The failure count is returned by the script
#   
#
